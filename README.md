# VideoTube
This is a Microsoft Software &amp; Systems Academy project that utilizes the ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC formate for web apps. The purpose of this project is to get experience with building a website that hosts video media, similar to YouTube.

ASP.NET Core 2.2 MVC web app
 - Published and hosted on Azure.
 - Azure server connection established with use of Azure Key Vault to hide API connection keys.
 - Two Databases used. One for user login/registration and another for everything else the site handles (this is to decrease the amount of sensitive information in transit).
 - Email authentication implemented for user accounts using SendGrid.
 - Used Bootstrap 4 for a majority of the styling and front end development.
 - Created interaction with and connection to Azure Blob Storage (upload, download, create container, and list blobs).
